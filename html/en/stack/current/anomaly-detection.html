<p>The machine learning features automate the analysis of time series data by creating
accurate baselines of normal behavior in the data and identifying anomalous
patterns in that data. You can submit your data for analysis in batches or
continuously in real-time datafeeds.</p>
<p>Using <a class="xref" href="anomaly-detection.html#anomaly-algorithms" title="Anomaly detection algorithms">proprietary machine learning algorithms</a>, the following
circumstances are detected, scored, and linked with statistically significant
influencers in the data:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Anomalies related to temporal deviations in values, counts, or frequencies
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Statistical rarity
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Unusual behaviors for a member of a population
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Automated periodicity detection and quick adaptation to changing data ensure
that you don’t need to specify algorithms, models, or other data science-related
configurations in order to get the benefits of machine learning.</p>
<p>You can view the machine learning results in Kibana where, for example, charts illustrate the
actual data values, the bounds for the expected values, and the anomalies that
occur outside these bounds.</p>

<h3><a id="ml-forecasting"></a>Forecasting the future<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/forecasting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>After the machine learning features create baselines of normal behavior for your data,
you can use that information to extrapolate future behavior.</p>
<p>You can use a forecast to estimate a time series value at a specific future date.
For example, you might want to determine how many users you can expect to visit
your website next Sunday at 0900.</p>
<p>You can also use it to estimate the probability of a time series value occurring
at a future date. For example, you might want to determine how likely it is that
your disk utilization will reach 100% before the end of next week.</p>
<p>Each forecast has a unique ID, which you can use to distinguish between forecasts
that you created at different times. You can create a forecast by using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-forecast.html" class="ulink" target="_top">forecast anomaly detection jobs API</a> or by using Kibana. For
example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/overview-forecast.jpg" alt="Example screenshot from the Machine Learning Single Metric Viewer in Kibana">
</div>
</div>
<p>The yellow line in the chart represents the predicted data values. The
shaded yellow area represents the bounds for the predicted values, which also
gives an indication of the confidence of the predictions.</p>
<p>When you create a forecast, you specify its <em>duration</em>, which indicates how far
the forecast extends beyond the last record that was processed. By default, the
duration is 1 day. Typically the farther into the future that you forecast, the
lower the confidence levels become (that is to say, the bounds increase).
Eventually if the confidence levels are too low, the forecast stops.
For more information about limitations that affect your ability to create a
forecast, see <a class="xref" href="ml-forecast-limitations.html" title="Forecast limitations">Forecast limitations</a>.</p>
<p>You can also optionally specify when the forecast expires. By default, it
expires in 14 days and is deleted automatically thereafter. You can specify a
different expiration period by using the <code class="literal">expires_in</code> parameter in the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-forecast.html" class="ulink" target="_top">forecast anomaly detection jobs API</a>.</p>

<p>The anomaly detection machine learning features use a bespoke amalgamation of different
techniques such as clustering, various types of time series decomposition,
Bayesian distribution modeling, and correlation analysis. These analytics
provide sophisticated real-time automated anomaly detection for time series data.</p>
<p>The machine learning analytics statistically model the time-based characteristics of your
data by observing historical behavior and adapting to new data. The model
represents a baseline of normal behavior and can therefore be used to determine
how anomalous new events are.</p>
<p>Anomaly detection results are written for each <a class="xref" href="anomaly-detection.html#ml-buckets" title="Buckets">bucket span</a>.
These results include scores that are aggregated in order to reduce noise and
normalized in order to rank the most mathematically significant anomalies. For
more information, see <a class="xref" href="anomaly-detection.html#ml-bucket-results" title="Bucket results">Bucket results</a> and <a class="xref" href="anomaly-detection.html#ml-influencer-results" title="Influencer results">Influencer results</a>.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Anomaly detection jobs contain the configuration information and metadata
necessary to perform an analytics task.</p>
<p>Each anomaly detection job has one or more <em>detectors</em>. A detector applies an analytical
function to specific fields in your data. For more information about the types
of analysis you can perform, see <a class="xref" href="ml-functions.html" title="Machine learning functions">Machine learning functions</a>.</p>
<p>A job can also contain properties that affect which types of entities or events
are considered anomalous. For example, you can specify whether entities are
analyzed relative to their own previous behavior or relative to other entities
in a population. There are also multiple options for splitting the data into
categories and partitions. Some of these more advanced job configurations
are described in the following section: <a class="xref" href="anomaly-examples.html" title="Anomaly detection examples">Anomaly detection examples</a>.</p>
<p>For a description of all the job properties, see the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-put-job.html" class="ulink" target="_top">create anomaly detection jobs API</a>.</p>
<p>In Kibana, there are wizards that help you create specific types of jobs, such
as <em>single metric</em>, <em>multi-metric</em>, and <em>population</em> jobs. A single metric job
is just a job with a single detector and limited job properties. To have access
to all of the job properties in Kibana, you must choose the <em>advanced</em> job wizard.</p>
<p>You can also optionally assign jobs to one or more <em>job groups</em>. You can use
job groups to view the results from multiple jobs more easily and to expedite
administrative tasks by opening or closing multiple jobs at once.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The machine learning features use the concept of a <em>bucket</em> to divide the time series into
batches for processing.</p>
<p>The <em>bucket span</em> is part of the configuration information for an anomaly detection job.
It defines the time interval that is used to summarize and model the data. This
is typically between 5 minutes to 1 hour and it depends on your data
characteristics. When you set the bucket span, take into account the granularity
at which you want to analyze, the frequency of the input data, the typical
duration of the anomalies, and the frequency at which alerting is required.</p>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<h4 class="title"><a id="ml-bucket-results"></a>Bucket results<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/buckets.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
</div></div></div>
<p>When you view your machine learning results, each bucket has an anomaly score. This score is
a statistically aggregated and normalized view of the combined anomalousness of
all the record results in the bucket.</p>
<p>The machine learning analytics enhance the anomaly score for each bucket by considering
contiguous buckets. This extra <em>multi-bucket analysis</em> effectively uses a
sliding window to evaluate the events in each bucket relative to the larger
context of recent events. When you review your machine learning results, there is a
<code class="literal">multi_bucket_impact</code> property that indicates how strongly the final anomaly
score is influenced by multi-bucket analysis. In Kibana, anomalies with medium or
high multi-bucket impact are depicted in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> and the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> with a cross symbol instead of a dot. For example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/multibucketanalysis.jpg" alt="Examples of anomalies with multi-bucket impact in Kibana">
</div>
</div>
<p>In this example, you can see that some of the anomalies fall within the shaded
blue area, which represents the bounds for the expected values. The bounds are
calculated per bucket, but multi-bucket analysis is not limited by that scope.</p>
<p>If you have more than one anomaly detection job, you can also obtain <em>overall bucket</em>
results, which combine and correlate anomalies from multiple jobs into an
overall score. When you view the results for job groups in Kibana, it provides
the overall bucket scores. For more information, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-get-overall-buckets.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Get overall buckets API</a>.</p>
<p>Bucket results provide the top level, overall view of the anomaly detection job and are
ideal for alerts. For example, the bucket results might indicate that at 16:05
the system was unusual. This information is a summary of all the anomalies,
pinpointing when they occurred. When you identify an anomalous bucket, you can
investigate further by examining the pertinent records.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a id="ml-dfeeds"></a>Datafeeds<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/datafeeds.asciidoc">edit</a><a class="xpack_tag" href="/subscriptions"></a></h3>
</div></div></div>
<p>Anomaly detection jobs can analyze data that is stored in Elasticsearch or data that is
sent from some other source via an API. <em>Datafeeds</em> retrieve data from Elasticsearch
for analysis, which is the simpler and more common scenario.</p>
<p>You can associate only one datafeed with each anomaly detection job. The datafeed contains
a query that runs at a defined interval (<code class="literal">frequency</code>). By default, this interval
is calculated relative to the <a class="xref" href="anomaly-detection.html#ml-buckets" title="Buckets">bucket span</a> of the anomaly detection job.
If you are concerned about delayed data, you can add a delay before the query
runs at each interval. See <a class="xref" href="ml-delayed-data-detection.html" title="Handling delayed data">Handling delayed data</a>.</p>
<p>Datafeeds can also aggregate data before sending it to the anomaly detection job.
There are some limitations, however, and aggregations should generally be used
only for low cardinality data. See <a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-aggregation.html" title="Aggregating data for faster performance">Aggregating data for faster performance</a>.</p>
<p>If you create anomaly detection jobs in Kibana, you <em>must</em> use datafeeds. When you create
an anomaly detection job, you select an index pattern and Kibana configures the datafeed
for you under the covers. For a description of all the datafeed properties, see
the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-put-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">create datafeeds API</a>.</p>
<p>To start retrieving data from Elasticsearch, you must start the datafeed. When you start
it, you can optionally specify start and end times. If you do not specify an
end time, the datafeed runs continuously. You can start and stop datafeeds in
Kibana or use the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-start-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">start datafeeds</a> and
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-stop-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">stop datafeeds</a> APIs. A datafeed can be started and
stopped multiple times throughout its lifecycle.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>When the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, a datafeed stores the roles of the
user who created or updated the datafeed at that time. This means that if those
roles are updated, the datafeed subsequently runs with the new permissions that
are associated with the roles. However, if the user’s roles are adjusted after
creating or updating the datafeed, the datafeed continues to run with the
permissions that were associated with the original roles.</p>
<p>One way to update the roles that are stored within the datafeed without changing
any other settings is to submit an empty JSON document ({}) to the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-update-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">update datafeed API</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If the data that you want to analyze is not stored in Elasticsearch, you cannot use
datafeeds. You can however send batches of data directly to the job by using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-post-data.html" class="ulink" target="_top">post data to jobs API</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a id="ml-influencers"></a>Influencers<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/influencers.asciidoc">edit</a><a class="xpack_tag" href="/subscriptions"></a></h3>
</div></div></div>
<p>When anomalous events occur, we want to know why. To determine the cause,
however, you often need a broader knowledge of the domain. If you have
suspicions about which entities in your dataset are likely causing
irregularities, you can identify them as influencers in your anomaly detection jobs.
That is to say, <em>influencers</em> are fields that you suspect contain information
about someone or something that influences or contributes to anomalies in your
data.</p>
<p>Influencers can be any field in your data. If you use datafeeds, however, the
field must exist in your datafeed query or aggregation; otherwise it is not
included in the job analysis. If you use a query in your datafeed, there is an
additional requirement: influencer fields must exist in the query results in the
same hit as the detector fields. Datafeeds process data by paging through the
query results; since search hits cannot span multiple indices or documents,
datafeeds have the same limitation.</p>
<p>Influencers do not need to be fields that are specified in your anomaly detection job
detectors, though they often are. If you use aggregations in your datafeed, it is
possible to use influencers that come from different indices than the detector
fields. However, both indices must have a date field with the same name, which you
specify in the <code class="literal">data_description</code>.<code class="literal">time_field</code> property for the datafeed.</p>
<p>Picking an influencer is strongly recommended for the following reasons:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
It allows you to more easily assign blame for anomalies
</li>
<li class="listitem">
It simplifies and aggregates the results
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you use Kibana, the job creation wizards can suggest which fields to use as
influencers. The best influencer is the person or thing that you want to blame
for the anomaly. In many cases, users or client IP addresses make excellent
influencers.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>As a best practice, do not pick too many influencers. For example, you
generally do not need more than three. If you pick many influencers, the results
can be overwhelming and there is a small overhead to the analysis.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h4 class="title"><a id="ml-influencer-results"></a>Influencer results<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/influencers.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
</div></div></div>
<p>The influencer results show which entities were anomalous and when. One
influencer result is written per bucket for each influencer that affects the
anomalousness of the bucket. The machine learning analytics determine the impact of an
influencer by performing a series of experiments that remove all data points
with a specific influencer value and check whether the bucket is still anomalous.
For jobs with more than one detector, influencer scores provide a powerful view
of the most anomalous entities.</p>
<p>For example, the <code class="literal">high_sum_total_sales</code> anomaly detection job for the eCommerce orders
sample data uses <code class="literal">customer_full_name.keyword</code> and <code class="literal">category.keyword</code> as
influencers. You can examine the influencer results with the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-get-influencer.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get influencers API</a>. Alternatively, you can use
the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> in Kibana:</p>

<p>On the left is a list of the top influencers for all of the detected anomalies
in that same time period. The list includes maximum anomaly scores, which in
this case are aggregated for each influencer, for each bucket, across all
detectors. There is also a total sum of the anomaly scores for each influencer.
You can use this list to help you narrow down the contributing factors and focus
on the most anomalous entities.</p>
<p>You can also explore swim lanes that correspond to the values of an influencer.
In this example, the swim lanes correspond to the values for the
<code class="literal">customer_full_name.keyword</code>. By default, the swim lanes are sorted according to
which entity has the maximum anomaly score values. You can click on the sections
in the swim lane to see details about the anomalies that occurred in that time
interval.</p>

<p>The anomaly scores that you see in each section of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>
might differ slightly. This disparity occurs because for each anomaly detection job,
there are bucket results, influencer results, and record results. Anomaly scores
are generated for each type of result. The anomaly timeline in Kibana uses the
bucket-level anomaly scores. If you view swim lanes by influencer, it uses the
influencer-level anomaly scores, as does the list of top influencers. The list
of anomalies uses the record-level anomaly scores.</p>
