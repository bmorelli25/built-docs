varies.</p>

<p>Kibana upgrades automatically when starting a new version, as described in

Although you do not need to manually back up Kibana before upgrading, we recommend
that you have a backup on hand. You can use
<a class="xref" href="snapshot-repositories.html" title="Snapshot and Restore">Snapshot and Restore</a> to back up Kibana
data by targeting <code class="literal">.kibana*</code> indices. If you are using the Reporting plugin,
you can also target <code class="literal">.reporting*</code> indices.</p>

<p>To identify the changes you need to make to upgrade, and to enable you to
perform an Elasticsearch rolling upgrade with no downtime, you must upgrade to
6.7 before you upgrade to 7.0.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive overview of the upgrade process, refer to
<span class="strong strong"><strong><a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/7.5/upgrading-elastic-stack.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrading the Elastic Stack</a></strong></span>.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch can read indices created in the previous major version. Before you upgrade
to 7.0.0, you must reindex or delete any indices created in 5.x or earlier.
For more information, refer to
<a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/7.5/upgrading-elastic-stack.html#oss-stack-upgrade" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrading the Elastic Stack</a>.</p>
<p>When your reindex is complete, follow the <a class="xref" href="upgrade-standard.html" title="Standard upgrade">Standard upgrade</a>
instructions.</p>

<p>The recommended path is to upgrade to 6.8 before upgrading to 7.0. This makes it
easier to identify the required changes, and enables you to use the Upgrade
Assistant to prepare for your upgrade to 7.0.</p>

<p>After upgrading to Elasticsearch 7.0, any indices created by Beats 6.6 or older will not
work in Kibana dashboards until the <code class="literal">index.query.default_field</code> setting is added
to each index. Indices created in Beats 6.7 or later are unaffected.
To add the setting to the index, you can use the 7.0
