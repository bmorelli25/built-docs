<p>The Uptime settings page lets you change which Heartbeat indices are displayed
by the uptime app. Users must have the <em>all</em> permission to modify items on this page.
Uptime settings apply to the current space only. Use different settings in different
spaces to segment different uptime use cases and domains.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine your organization has one team for internal IT services, and another
for public services. Each team operates independently and is only responsible for its
own services. In this scenario, you might set up separate Heartbeat instances for each team,
writing out to index patterns named <code class="literal">it-heartbeat-\*</code>, and <code class="literal">external-heartbeat-\*</code>. You would
create separate roles and users for each in Elasticsearch, each with access to their own spaces,
named <code class="literal">it</code> and <code class="literal">external</code> respectively. Within each space you would navigate to the settings page
and set the correct index pattern to match only the indices that space is allowed to access.</p>
<p>Note that the pattern set here only restricts what the Uptime app shows. Users may still be able
to manually query Elasticsearch for data outside this pattern!</p>
