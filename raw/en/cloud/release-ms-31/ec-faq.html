<a id="faq-what"></a>What is Elasticsearch Service?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Elasticsearch Service is hosted and managed Elasticsearch and Kibana brought to you by the creators of Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch Service is part of Elastic Cloud and ships with features that you can only get from the company behind Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash. Elasticsearch is a full text search engine that suits a range of uses, from search on websites to big data analytics and more.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-aws-difference"></a>Is Elasticsearch Service the same as Amazon&#8217;s Elasticsearch Service?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Elasticsearch Service is not the same as the Amazon Elasticsearch service. To learn more about the differences, see our <a href="/aws-elasticsearch-service" class="ulink" target="_top">AWS Elasticsearch Service</a> comparison.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-full-stack"></a>Can I run the full Elastic Stack in Elasticsearch Service?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Many of the products that are part of the Elastic Stack are readily available in Elasticsearch Service, including Elasticsearch, Kibana, X-Pack features such as monitoring and security, and others, including plugins. Other Elastic Stack products you can use directly with Elasticsearch Service, even if they don&#8217;t currently run there. For example, both Logstash and Beats can send their data to Elasticsearch Service, just as you would send data to any other Elasticsearch cluster. What you can run is also determined by your <a href="/cloud/as-a-service/subscriptions" class="ulink" target="_top">subscription level</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-trial"></a>Can I try Elasticsearch Service for free?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Yes, you can sign up for a 14-day trial. The trial starts the moment you create a cluster.
</p>
<p>During the free trial period, you get access to a free deployment with the latest Elasticsearch and Kibana versions, security features, machine learning, and much more.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-config"></a>What if I need to change the size of my Elasticsearch cluster at a later time?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
You can scale your clusters both up and down from the user console, whenever you like. The resizing of the cluster is transparently done in the background, without any downtime. Beware, however, that if you scale your cluster down, you must ensure that the downsized cluster can handle your Elasticsearch memory requirements. Read more about sizing and memory in our articles <a href="/blog/found-sizing-elasticsearch" class="ulink" target="_top">Sizing Elasticsearch</a> and <a href="/blog/found-elasticsearch-in-production/#memory" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch in Production</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-subscriptions"></a>Do you offer support?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Yes, all subscription levels for Elasticsearch Service include support, handled by email or through the Elastic Support Portal. Different subscription levels include different levels of support. For the Standard subscription level, there is no service-level agreement (SLA) on support response times. Gold and Platinum subscription levels include an SLA on response times to tickets and dedicated resources. To learn more, see <a class="xref" href="ec-get-help.html" title="Getting help">Getting Help</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-where"></a>Where is Elasticsearch Service hosted?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
We host our Elasticsearch clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. Check out which <a href="/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-reference-regions.html" class="ulink" target="_top">regions we support</a> and what <a href="/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-reference-hardware.html" class="ulink" target="_top">hardware we use</a>. New data centers get added all the time.

<span class="term">
<a id="faq-vs-aws"></a>What is the difference between Elasticsearch Service and the Amazon Elasticsearch Service?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Elasticsearch Service is the only hosted and managed Elasticsearch service built, managed, and supported by the company behind Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash. With Elasticsearch Service, you always get the latest versions of the software. Our service is built on best practices and years of experience hosting and managing thousands of Elasticsearch clusters in the cloud and on premise. We support custom scripts and dictionaries, and Elasticsearch Service Gold and Platinum customers can upload and run custom plugins with the service. We are the only Elasticsearch as a service offering where you get access to <a href="/cloud/as-a-service/subscriptions" class="ulink" target="_top">our commercial features and plugins</a>.
</p>
<p>Please note that there is no formal partnership between Elastic and Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Elastic does not provide any support on the AWS Elasticsearch Service.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-aws"></a>Can I use Elasticsearch Service on platforms other than AWS?
</span>
</dt>

<p>As a gesture to startups and small businesses using Elasticsearch Service, you are also entitled to use some X-Pack features that are part of the Gold and Platinum subscription levels, as long as your clusters are using less than a combined 64GB of memory in total. This means that you get to enjoy access to field- and document-level security features and to graph capabilities.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-x-pack"></a>Is my Elasticsearch cluster protected by X-Pack?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Yes, X-Pack security features give you the full power to protect your Elasticsearch Service deployment with basic authentication and role-based access control.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-limit"></a>Is there a limit on the number of documents or indexes I can have in my cluster?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
No. We do not enforce any artificial limit on the number of indexes or documents you can store in your cluster.
</p>
<p>That said, there is a limit to how many indexes Elasticsearch can cope with. Every shard of every index is a separate Lucene index, which in turn comprises several files. A process cannot have an unlimited number of open files. Also, every shard has its associated control structures in memory. So, while we will let you make as many indexes as you want, there are limiting factors. Our larger plans provide your processes with more dedicated memory and CPU-shares, so they are capable of handling more indexes. The number of indexes or documents you can fit in a given plan therefore depends on their structure and use.</p>

<a id="faq-cost"></a>Is there a way for me to estimate how much Elasticsearch Service will cost?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Yes, there is: Try our <a href="/cloud/elasticsearch-service/pricing" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Pricing Calculator</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-charge"></a>Why is my card charged?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The charge is a recurring fee for using our hosted Elasticsearch service. The fee is normally charged at the start of each month, but it can also be charged at other times during the month. If a charge is unsuccessful, we will try to charge your card again at a later date.
</p>
<p>To locate the charge, please look for <span class="strong strong"><strong>ELASTIC charge.elastic.co</strong></span> on the credit card statement from your card issuer.</p>
<p>If you still do not recognize the charge on your the credit card statement, the service is probably purchased by someone else in your company. A good guess would be someone from the development or operations team. Please ask someone there and see if they know about Elasticsearch Service or Found, as the service was previously named.</p>

<span class="term">
<a id="faq-history"></a>How do I view previous receipts and billing history?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
See the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/account/billing-history" class="ulink" target="_top">billing history</a>, where you can view and download receipts for all previous charges. If you do not have the login details, ask the person or department in your company who is responsible for handling the Elasticsearch Service billing details.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-notify"></a>How can I change who receives receipts and billing notifications?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The account owner can change who receives receipts and billing notifications by changing the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/account/profile" class="ulink" target="_top">email details</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-refund"></a>Can I get a refund?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Charges are non-refundable, but once you delete a deployment, we&#8217;ll stop charging you for that deployment immediately. You only pay for what you use and you can stop using the service at any time.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-payment"></a>What are the available payment methods on Elasticsearch Service?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
For month-to-month payments only credit cards are accepted. We also do allow payments by bank transfer for annual subscriptions. Please contact <a href="mailto:ar@elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">ar@elastic.co</a> for more details.

</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<a href="/blog/hot-warm-architecture" class="ulink" target="_top"><em>hot-warm architecture</em></a> refers to an Elasticsearch setup for larger time-data analytics use cases with two different types of nodes, hot and warm.
Elasticsearch Service supports creating your own <a class="xref" href="ec-getting-started-templates-hot-warm.html" title="Hot-warm architecture template">hot-warm architecture</a> through a ready-made deployment template that you can configure for your own use case.
</dd>
<dt>

<a id="faq-tribe-node"></a>Can I run tribe nodes or cross-cluster search?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/modules-tribe.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Tribe nodes</a> act as federated clients across multiple clusters, meaning they can issue read and write operations against the nodes in all clusters. <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/modules-cross-cluster-search.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Cross-cluster search</a> allows any node to act as a federated client across multiple clusters, without joining those clusters as a node. Elasticsearch Service supports cross-cluster search, which is our newer feature and preferred over tribe nodes.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-master-nodes"></a>What about dedicated master nodes?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/modules-node.html#master-node" class="ulink" target="_top">Master nodes</a> are responsible for cluster-wide actions, such as creating or deleting an index, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster, and deciding which shards to allocate to which nodes.

<a id="faq-ssl"></a>Can I use a Custom SSL certificate?

We don&#8217;t support custom SSL certificates, which means that a custom CNAME for an Elasticsearch Service endpoint such as <em>mycluster.mycompanyname.com</em> also is not supported.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-peering"></a>Do you support VPC peering to Elasticsearch Service?
</span>

<dd>
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/vpc-peering-overview.html" class="ulink" target="_top">VPC peering</a> is a type of connection between virtual private networks that is used to route network traffic. We support secure peering using AWS Private Link. To run Elasticsearch Service in a dedicated VPC with a secure connection from your environment, use the Elasticsearch Service Private subscription. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="ec-getting-started-private.html" title="Set up Elasticsearch Service Private">Set up Elasticsearch Service Private</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-autoscale"></a>Can Elasticsearch Service autoscale?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
We don&#8217;t support autoscaling, but it is extremely easy for you to scale your Elasticsearch cluster via the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a> without interrupting the availability of your cluster. It&#8217;s as easy as moving a slider and saving your changes.
</p>
<p>True autoscaling would require a fairly close analysis of the load on your cluster and would have to be performed preemptively, before your cluster is loaded up, so as to allow time for the new nodes to be operational before they can help reduce load or request times. Clusters scaling up automatically could also negatively affect your billing. We don&#8217;t want you to receive an unexpectedly large bill for a cluster that got scaled up automatically without your consent.</p>

<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-ip-sniffing"></a>Do you support IP sniffing?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
IP sniffing is not supported by design and will not return the expected results. We prevent IP sniffing from returning the expected results to improve the security of our underlying Elasticsearch Service infrastructure.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-encryption-at-rest"></a>Does Elasticsearch Service support encryption at rest?
</span>
