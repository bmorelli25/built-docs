<p>Google Cloud Platform Marketplace billing is a convenient way to subscribe to Elasticsearch Service if you already use Google Cloud Platform (GCP). With GCP Marketplace billing, you can add an Elasticsearch Service subscription right to your GCP bill and do not have to supply any additional credit card information to Elastic.</p>
<p>Some differences exist when using GCP Marketplace billing:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
There is no trial offered with GCP Marketplace billing. Billing starts when you subscribe to Elasticsearch Service.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Previous Elasticsearch Service accounts cannot be converted to GCP Marketplace billing. If you already have an account, you must use a different email address when you sign up for a subscription through the GCP Marketplace.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Pricing for an Elasticsearch Service subscription through the GCP Marketplace differs from our direct billing model and follows the pricing outlined on the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/endpoints/elasticsearch-service-on-elastic-cloud-standard" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud - Standard</a> page in the GCP Marketplace. Pricing is based on the GCP region (Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific), the RAM size of your cluster in GB, and the level of high availability, billed per hour.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Billing details for your Elasticsearch Service subscription are shown in the GCP Marketplace billing console. It can take from six to twenty-four hours before new charges show up. If charges do not show up quickly enough, you can estimate your costs based on the formula in the next bullet. You can also <a href="https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/reports" class="ulink" target="_top">view your billing reports and cost trends</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Billing information in the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a> indicates only the general pricing details and hourly usage. Costs can be estimated based on the pricing information provided. For example, if you create a highly available cluster across two availability zones each with a <code class="literal">gcp.data.highio.1</code> instance with 8 GB of RAM, the hourly cost would be the <code class="literal">gcp.data.highio.1</code> rate x 8 GB of RAM x 2 availability zones.

<h3><a id="ec-billing-gcp-account-change"></a>Changes to your Billing Account</h3>
<p>While Elasticsearch Service subscriptions via GCP Marketplace are associated with a GCP project, that project must be associated with a GCP billing account. Due to a current limitation of the GCP Marketplace, changes to the billing account associated with your project may cause disruption to your Elasticsearch Service deployments.</p>
<p>Deployments in this scenario may be put into maintenance mode and operate in a degraded state until you have re-enabled your subscription within the GCP Marketplace. With no further action, deployments will be terminated after 14 days.</p>
<p>To re-enable your subscription:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Go to the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/endpoints/elasticsearch-service-on-elastic-cloud-standard" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud - Standard</a> page in the GCP Marketplace.
</li>
<li class="listitem">

</li>
<li class="listitem">
On the the Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud - Standard page, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span> within 14 days from the time of disruption, your deployments will begin operating again momentarily and usage fees will take effect from the time that the service is enabled.
