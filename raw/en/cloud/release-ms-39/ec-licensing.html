<p>For more information on what is available with different subscription levels, see <a href="/elasticsearch/service/pricing" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Subscriptions</a>. You are entitled to use all of the features in Elasticsearch Service that match your subscription level. Please use them to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>If you have a Standard subscription for Elasticsearch Service, you are also entitled to use all Platinum features (except custom  plugins) available on Elasticsearch Service, as long as your deployments are using less than a combined 64GB of memory in  total. This means that you get to enjoy access to features like anomaly detection, field- and document-level  security and graph capabilities.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_what_happens_if_i_reach_64gb_on_a_standard_subscription"></a>What happens If I reach 64GB on a Standard subscription?</h3>
<p>We sum up the total memory on all of your clusters, and when you exceed a combined total of 64GB RAM, you&#8217;ll get a notification that access to Gold, Platinum, and Private security features requires upgrading to a Gold, Platinum, or Private subscription. These features are automatically disabled after a grace period of 45 days, unless you upgrade your subscription or reduce your total RAM usage to 64GB or less.</p>
<p>If you want to continue using those features beyond 64GB RAM total, <a href="/cloud/contact" class="ulink" target="_top">you should contact us</a>. If you need more time to upgrade your subscription while talking to our Sales team, the grace period can be extended. We&#8217;re here to help.</p>
<p>Your upgraded subscription determines <a href="/elasticsearch/service/pricing" class="ulink" target="_top">which features are available</a>. For example, machine learning and SAML authentication requires a Platinum or Private subscription and is not available if you upgrade to a Gold subscription.</p>
