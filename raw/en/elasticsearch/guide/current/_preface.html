<p>The world is swimming in data.  For years we have been simply overwhelmed by
the quantity of data flowing through and produced by our systems.  Existing
technology has focused on how to store and structure warehouses full of data.
That&#8217;s all well and good&#8212;&#8203;until you actually need to make decisions in
real time informed by that data.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch is a distributed, scalable, real-time search and analytics engine.
It enables you to search, analyze, and explore your data, often in ways that
you did not anticipate at the start of a project.  It exists because raw data
sitting on a hard drive is just not useful.</p>
<p>Whether you need full-text search, real-time analytics of structured data, or
a combination of the two, this book introduces you to the fundamental
concepts required to start working with Elasticsearch at a basic level. With
these foundations laid, it will move on to more-advanced search techniques,
which you will need to shape the search experience to fit your requirements.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch is not just about full-text search. We explain structured
search, analytics, the complexities of dealing with human language,
geolocation, and relationships. We will also discuss how best to model your
data to take advantage of the horizontal scalability of Elasticsearch, and how
to configure and monitor your cluster when moving to production.</p>
