On dedicated servers, getting the traffic from mirror ports or tap devices.
</li><li class="listitem">
On your existing application servers.
</li></ul></div><p>The first option has the big advantage that there is no overhead of any kind on
your application servers. But it requires dedicated networking gear, which is
generally not available on cloud setups.</p><p>In both cases, the sniffing performance (reading packets passively from the network)
is very important. In the case of a dedicated server, better
sniffing performance means that less hardware is required. When Packetbeat is installed
on an existing application server, better sniffing performance means less overhead.</p><p>Currently Packetbeat has several options for traffic capturing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">pcap</code>, which uses the libpcap library and works on most platforms, but
   it’s not the fastest option.
</li><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">af_packet</code>, which uses memory mapped sniffing. This option is faster than libpcap
    and doesn’t require a kernel module, but it’s Linux-specific.
</li><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">pf_ring</code>, which makes use of an ntop.org
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ntop.org/products/pf_ring/" target="_top">project</a>. This setting provides the best
   sniffing speed, but it requires recompilation and a kernel module, and it’s
   Linux-specific.
</li></ul></div><p>The <code class="literal">pf_ring</code> option provides sniffing speeds in the order of Gigabits per
second using only standard hardware, but it requires you to recompile Packetbeat
against the ntop libraries and is therefore currently not officially supported
by Elastic.</p><p>The <code class="literal">af_packet</code> option, also known as "memory-mapped sniffing," makes use of a
Linux-specific
<a class="ulink" href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/networking/packet_mmap.txt" target="_top">feature</a>.
This could be the optimal sniffing mode for both the dedicated server and
when Packetbeat is deployed on an existing application server.</p><p>The way it works is that both the kernel and the user space program map the
same memory zone, and a simple circular buffer is organized in this memory zone.
The kernel writes packets into the circular buffer, and the user space program
reads from it. The poll system call is used for getting a notification for the
first packet available, but the remaining available packets can be simply read
via memory access.</p><p>This option is not quite as fast as <code class="literal">pf_ring</code> (it works to up to 200k packets
per second before dropping packets), but it requires no recompilation and no
kernel modules, and it’s still a significant improvement over libpcap.</p><p>The <code class="literal">af_packet</code> sniffer can be further tuned to use more memory in exchange for
better performance. The larger the size of the circular buffer, the fewer
system calls are needed, which means that fewer CPU cycles are consumed. The default size
of the buffer is 30 MB, but you can increase it like this:</p><div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml"><pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">packetbeat.interfaces.device: eth0
packetbeat.interfaces.type: af_packet
packetbeat.interfaces.buffer_size_mb: 100</pre></div><p>Please see the <a class="xref" href="configuration-interfaces.html" title="Network Device Configuration">Network Device Configuration</a> section for more
configuration options.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="using-environ-vars.html">
